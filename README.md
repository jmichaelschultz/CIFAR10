# CIFAR10

Hello any reader, 

This repo is me just learning the tensorflow/keras libraries. I publish publicly cuz why not


1st commit - DNN on CIFAR experimenting with learning rate schedulers, and other callbacks


Future considerations: Accuracy is reeeeaaaalll bad using a Large DNN to solve this problem. If i were to really try to solve this problem i would try and implement a CNN. I may experiment with that in the future.....
